1. Visual representation of table-level lineage dependencies between upstream and downstream dbt models using a DAG (data acyclic graph) based playground.
2. Automated lineage update using **Sync**.
3. Supports **search** function for a model, including complex searches (e.g., 2\+model\+2) to view the immediate dependencies
4. View the full lineage graph, **zoom in/out** and **download** view in SVG.
