5X does not store customer data. We operate as a secure layer on top of your chosen data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, Google BigQuery). This means:

- **Your data stays put:** All your business data only remains in your data warehouse.
- **5X only handles metadata:** 5X stores and processes only the essential metadata (e.g., user info, encrypted connection details, usage stats) needed to run our platform efficiently.

This approach gives you the full power of 5X's end-to-end data platform while keeping your data firmly under your control.

## Types of Data Collected by 5X

- **Personal Data:** Names, email addresses, and other contact information, from users of the 5X platform to facilitate communication and service delivery.
- **Usage Metadata:** Our platform gathers metadata, including IP addresses, browser types, and device details, to optimize user experience and enhance security.
- **Analytics Data:** We leverage aggregated, anonymized data to continuously refine our services. 
- **Financial Data:** For payment processing, we rely on Stripe's secure platform, ensuring that sensitive financial information is never stored on our servers.

## Data Processing Activities

### Data Collection
5X collects only customer metadata, including usernames, emails, warehouse account details etc. Your primary data resides in the customer's data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, Google BigQuery).

### Data Usage
Collected data is used strictly for service provision, user experience enhancement, and analyticsâ€”always within the bounds of customer consent.

### Third-Party Service Providers
We utilize select third-party sub-processors to support our data processing operations. All third-party engagements are governed by robust Data Processing Agreements, ensuring they maintain the same high standards of data protection as 5X.

### Data Retention
The retention period for collected data varies based on its type and purpose:

- **Account information:** Retained for the duration of the customer's active account, plus a grace period after account closure for potential reactivation.
- **Usage data:** Retained for 12 months to support trend analysis and service improvement.
- **Financial data:** Retained in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, typically 7 years

### Data Deletion
We have implemented robust procedures for the proper deletion and disposal of data:

- **Automated Deletion:** Data that has exceeded its retention period is automatically flagged for deletion by our system.
- **Secure Erasure:** We use industry-standard secure erasure methods to ensure that deleted data cannot be recovered.
- **Hardware Disposal:** When hardware is decommissioned, we use certified data destruction services to ensure all data is irrevocably destroyed.
- **Customer Requests:** Upon customer request, we can initiate an immediate data deletion process, ensuring all customer data is removed from our systems within 30 days.

## Security Measures

### Network Security

- **Firewalls:** Our network is protected by multi-layered firewalls, designed to thwart unauthorized access attempts and provide an additional security perimeter.
- **Secure VPN Access:** Access to sensitive databases is controlled via an internal private VPN, available only to authorized personnel, ensuring secure and encrypted connections.

### Application Security

#### Identity Management
We utilize Auth0 as our Identity Provider, providing secure and seamless authentication for all users.

#### Password Policy
5X implements a robust password policy to ensure account security:
- Minimum 8 characters with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Secure password storage using Bcrypt hashing algorithm.

#### Access Control
5X implements a robust and flexible access control system:
- **Granular Permissions:** Our platform supports highly customizable, fine-grained access controls, allowing organizations to define and manage user permissions at a granular level.
- **Custom Role Creation:** Customers have the ability to create and configure custom roles tailored to their specific organizational needs and security requirements.

#### Encryption
All data transmissions are secured with HTTPS, and sensitive data at rest is protected using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. The encryption keys are rotated at regular intervals to ensure ongoing security.

#### Regular Audits and Security Testing
As part of our SOC 2 Type II compliance, we conduct frequent security audits and rigorous testing to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities. This includes:

- **Vulnerability Assessments:** Quarterly scans to identify potential security weaknesses in our systems.
- **Penetration Testing:** Annual testing that simulates real-world attacks to ensure our defenses are robust.
- **Network Security Assessments:** Quarterly assessments of both internal and external networks to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Web Application Security Testing:** Regular testing to protect against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Incident Response Testing:** Annual drills to ensure our incident response plan is effective and up-to-date.

## Compliance and Certifications

- **SOC 2 Type II:** Our commitment to security, availability, and confidentiality is validated through SOC 2 Type II certification, ensuring our practices meet the highest industry standards.
- **GDPR:** We adhere to GDPR requirements, ensuring that our data protection practices align with the regulations. Our processes fully comply with GDPR standards.
