The **SQL Editor** lets you write draft data queries quickly when you want to interact with your warehouse or update data for [Ingestion](/Ingestion/using-ingestion.mdx#using-ingestion). You can search for files using the search bar and manage actions on SQL files to rename, delete, and move files between folders.

## Prerequisite

Connect to the IDE using your [development credentials](/Settings/credentials.mdx).

## What you can do

1. Ensure your development workspace is connected to the right warehouse with the required warehouse role from your [worksheet](/IDE/about.mdx#worksheet)
2. Explore Data [sources](/Ingestion/sources.mdx#data-sources) in the [Schema](/IDE/about.mdx#schema) tab to preview table data or add columns or table name queries in the editor
3. Create your worksheet and organize it into files and folders from [Files](/IDE/about.mdx#files)
4. Query data using the [console](#query-console) to run multiple queries
5. Check query results, preview table data, and download results from the [Results panel](#results-bar)
