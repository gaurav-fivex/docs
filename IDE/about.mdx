title: "About IDE"
---

The **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** is a unified code editor built for data teams. It lets you access and model warehouse data to define and develop metrics in code centrally.

Users can work on multiple SQL, Python and dbt queries by connecting to the required warehouses and assigning their roles respectively on their workspace.

**Admins** and **developers** have [full access] to the **IDE** where they can:

- Run SQL queries using the [SQL editor](/IDE/sql) to update and manage warehouse data
- Model warehouse data using [dbt](/IDE/dbt/dbt) (data build tool) for downstream orchestration needs with version control management
- Work with python code

## Prerequisites

- Must have a [development credential](/Settings/credentials) connected to a Snowflake warehouse
- Must have **Admin** or **Developer** [5X role](/Team/rbac#5x-roles)
- Must enable dbt from [credentials](/Settings/credentials.mdx#credentials-) to run dbt queries on the IDE

## IDE Interface

The Editor is designed with the following components:

### Schema

The warehouse databases are updated in the **Schema** tab once the development credentials are configured. It provides a structured view of your warehouse schema with the databases and tables.

Key features:

1. **Search** schemas and tables in your database using the search box
2. **Refresh data sources**: Click the Refresh icon next to the Data sources section
3. **Place name in editor**: Quick-add table names to queries
4. **Preview data**: View table data and schema information
5. **Add columns in editor**: Select all columns from a table

### Worksheet

A worksheet is where you start drafting queries. The worksheets are maintained in the Files tab under:

- **My workspace**: Personal scratch pad for draft worksheets
- **Github**: Maintains your dbt repositories with version control

Each worksheet contains:

- Connection selector for warehouse role and development warehouse
- Code editor with syntax highlighting
- Query execution options like Run, Run all and Run with Limit 500

### Files

Manage your worksheets and repositories:

- **My workspace**: Draft and develop SQL queries
- **Github**: Connect to GitHub repositories for dbt projects
- Add, rename, move and delete files/folders
- Switch between branches

### Git

Support version control through Github repository integration:

- Manage multiple Git repositories
- File and branch version management
- Commit, sync, and merge changes
- Support for dbt and Python repositories
