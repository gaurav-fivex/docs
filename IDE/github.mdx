## Version Control Overview

### Branch Types
| Branch Type | Purpose | Naming Convention |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Main | Production code | `main` or `master` |
| Development | Feature development | `dev/feature-name` |
| Release | Release preparation | `release/v1.0.0` |
| Hotfix | Production fixes | `hotfix/issue-description` |

### Branch Protection if enabled on Github
- Changes require pull requests
- Tests must pass before merging
- Code review requirements

## Git Operations

4. **Merge Process**
   1. Create pull request

## Best Practices

### Branch Management
1. **Regular Syncs**
   - Keep branch updated
   - Resolve conflicts early
 
2. **Clean Branches**
   - Delete merged branches
   - Remove obsolete branches
 

### Commit Strategy
1. **Atomic Commits**
   - One logical change per commit

   - Reference tickets/issues

2. **Regular Commits**
  
   - Commit frequently
