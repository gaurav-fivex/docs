### Monitor Your Data Pipelines

View all your connectors with key information:

- Sync status (Active, Paused, Syncing, etc.)
- Last successful sync
- Next scheduled sync
- Source and destination details

### Quick Actions

Common tasks you can perform by clicking on the 3 dot icon on each connector.

- **Sync now** to run an instant sync irrespective of the connectorâ€™s sync frequency.
- **Edit Setup** to update the connector configuration and its setup.
- **Historical re-sync** is a full data re-sync operation where Ingestion overwrites the data in your destination with the latest data from your source. Click Historical re-sync to confirm.
- **Start/pause** syncs to change the status of connectors
- **Update sync frequency** (1 minute to custom periods) to change the sync frequency of connector
- **Filter and sort** connectors to view the connectors well.

### Understanding Connector States

| State | What It Means | What To Do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active | Successfully syncing data | Monitor as needed |
| Syncing | Currently moving data | Wait for completion |
| Paused | Sync schedule stopped | Resume if needed |
| Broken | Connection issue detected | Check configuration |
| Incomplete | Setup needs finishing | Complete setup |
