## Connector Setup & Management

### Configure Your Connector

- Click + Add Connector to open the Add Connector popup on the right.
- Search and select a data source from the supported sources to connect with a data warehouse and Continue.
- Select the destination where you want to migrate/replicate your data and Continue.
- Configure the connector details and Continue. 5X may require users to authenticate and authorize the connector to connect to the data source.
- After setting up, click Save & Test.

<Info>
A new connector has a default sync frequency of **6 hours** and is paused until the initial sync is completed.
</Info>

### Manage Existing Connectors

* Test connections
* Update configurations
* Monitor sync status
* Handle errors

## Schema Management

The schema structure lists your connector's schemas with their constituent tables and columns listed accordingly. 
Users can perform the following schema functions: 
1. **Expand/collapse** the structure to view the schemas and their path. 
   - Both active and inactive schemas are listed. 
   - The structure also highlights the primary key, foreign keys, and core tables.  
2. **Reload** the schema to the latest version by clicking the  **Reload** button on the **Schema** header. 
3. **Schema settings**: Users can control how the connector syncs newly added schema, columns and tables as required. Click the **Settings** dropdown to manage your schema settings. 
   - **Allow all** new schemas, tables and columns. 
   - **Allow columns** to block new schemas and configurable tables but allow new columns. 
   - **Block all** new schemas, configurable tables and columns.

### Security Features
Protect sensitive data while maintaining functionality:

### Column hashing/unhashing
It anonymizes sensitive data, like PII (personally identifiable information) in your destination while maintaining the ability to perform meaningful analysis. This technique transforms the original column values of a dataset into fixed-size hash codes, ensuring data privacy while retaining the ability to perform meaningful analysis. Column hashing is compliant with [GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)](https://gdpr-info.eu/).

Hover over the column to **hash/unhash** them before syncing the connector. Hasing/unhashing alters the column, and your data may be overwritten.

1. When you **unhash** a column, the source data values are replicated to the destination and have existing hashed values if there are any in the column. It returns a signed 64-bit hash value for the hashed data values. You can overwrite the hashed values and do a historical re-sync for the connector.

2. **Hashing** a column removes previously synced data and existing data values are set to NULL value for the column. To update the historical data values of the column, you can select **Re-sync historical data for the connector**.
