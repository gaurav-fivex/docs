# Credentials

You can run [SQL](/IDE/sql.mdx) and [dbt](/IDE/dbt/dbt.mdx) models from the [IDE](/IDE/about) using warehouse credentials. The warehouse credentials enable access to the development environment at the user level.  We support Snowflake warehouse for development credentials.\
Users can configure their development environment credentials from the **Credentials** page in **Settings**.
