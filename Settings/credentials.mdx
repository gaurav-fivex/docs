title: "Credentials"

You can run [SQL](/IDE/sql) and [dbt](/IDE/DBTModeling/dbt) models from the [IDE](/IDE/about) using warehouse credentials. The warehouse credentials enable access to the development environment at the user level. We support Snowflake warehouse for development credentials.
Users can configure their development environment credentials from the **Credentials** page in **Settings**.

## Configuration parameters 

| **Value**                	| **Description**                                                                                 	| **Parameters**                                                                        	|

| Default Role         	| The default warehouse role that IDE will assume when running queries.                       	| If you do not specify the warehouse, the role with the highest privilege is used. 	|
| Default warehouse    	| The default warehouse to use for running queries in development.                            	| If you do not specify, &lt;compute_wh&gt; is the default warehouse.               	|
| Authentication Type  	| The authentication type allows Ingestion to access and connect with the Snowflake account.  	| Supports username and password, and key pair authentication types.                	|
| dbt version          	| The dbt version to use for running dbt queries.                                             	| Supported versions are 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7.                                          	|
| Database             	| The default database where dbt models will be created.                                      	| Mandatory if dbt is enabled.                                                      	|
| Schema               	| The default schema where dbt models will be created.                                        	| Mandatory if dbt is enabled.                                                      	|

## Add credential

1. Select **+ Add credential** from the IDE or access Credentials from the [Settings](/Settings/settings) navigation bar.
2. Configure the Snowflake account details as required. **Enable dbt** if you want to run dbt queries on the IDE. 
3. Click **Create credential** on the top-right corner of the page.

4. The [IDE](/IDE/about) supports warehouse queries [using SQL](/IDE/sql) and data modeling using [dbt](/IDE/DBTModeling/dbt). You must enable dbt and configure the **version** and where the models will be stored, i.e., **database** and **schema**.

### Username & Password Authentication

Username and password authentication requires credentials from your warehouse account. This method uses basic account credentials to establish connections. You should have received a mail with these details:

- **Username**: Your warehouse account username (e.g., `FIVEX_USER`, `ADMIN`, etc.). Get this from your warehouse account administrator or create it via the warehouse console.
- **Password**: The corresponding password for the username. This is set when creating the user account or can be reset via warehouse account administration.

### Key Pair Authentication 

Key pair authentication uses asymmetric cryptography for enhanced security. You'll need to generate and configure a key pair:

- **Private Key**: A secure cryptographic key that stays on your system or with 5X. Generate this using OpenSSL with the command: 

```bash
openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -v2 des3 -inform PEM -out rsa_key.p8
```

- **Public Key**: The corresponding public key shared with the warehouse. Generate from your private key using:

```bash
 openssl rsa -in rsa_key.p8 -pubout -out rsa_key.pub
 ```
