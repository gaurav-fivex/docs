App connections maintain the production connections of your workspace to run [Ingestion](#ingestion), [Jobs](/Orchestration/jobs) and [BI](/Business-Intelligence/bi) (if included in your plan) capabilities. 5X sets up default Ingestion and orchestration connections when setting up your workspace. You can set up multiple production connections for a capability.

## Connection Types

5X supports connections for [Ingestion](/Ingestion/using-ingestion), Orchestration, and [BI](/Business-Intelligence/bi). Default Ingestion and orchestration connections are set up during workspace setup, allowing you to start [ingesting data](#ingestion) and run [SQL queries](/IDE/sql) on the [IDE](/Overview/features).

<Note>
- Currently, we support destination connections for Snowflake and Google BigQuery warehouses. 
- Default connections are set up regardless of how the warehouse account is provisioned.
</Note>
