## User Management

### Adding New Users

1. Navigate to the "Teams" section in your 5X workspace
2. Click "Add New User"
3. Enter the user details:
   - Name
   - Email (in format: name@fivex.co)
   - Select role (Member, Developer, Admin, or custom roles)
   - Assign warehouse role (e.g., Ingestion, Account Admin)

### Linking Existing Warehouse Users

Instead of creating new warehouse users, you can link existing warehouse users:
1. Select "Link Existing User" option while choosing warehouse roles
2. Choose the warehouse user to link
3. Associate with appropriate roles and permissions

### Importing Users

5X provides a streamlined process for importing existing warehouse users into the platform. This feature is particularly useful when you want to:
- Map existing warehouse users to 5X users
- Invite warehouse users who aren't yet on 5X

#### Import Process

1. Navigate to the Teams section
2. Click on "Import Users" option
3. You'll see a list of your warehouse users

For each warehouse user, you have two options:

**Option 1: Map to Existing 5X User**
1. Locate the warehouse user you want to map
2. Click on the corresponding 5X user from the dropdown
3. This action will link the warehouse user to the existing 5X user account
4. The user will maintain their existing 5X role and permissions

**Option 2: Invite New User to 5X**
1. For warehouse users not yet on 5X, click "Invite to 5X"
2. Enter the user details:
   - Provide a name (e.g., "Rock")
   - Select a 5X role from the available options
3. Click "Invite User"
4. The user will receive an invitation to join 5X with the specified role
