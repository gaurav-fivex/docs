### ðŸ‘¤ Access Rights

- Admin or Developer role access
- Warehouse credentials with appropriate permissions

### ðŸ”‘ Warehouse Setup

- Valid warehouse credentials
- Network access configured
- Required permissions granted

### ðŸ“š Knowledge

- Basic understanding of your warehouse configuration
- Familiarity with connection parameters

## Security Best Practices

- **Service Accounts**: Use dedicated service accounts instead of personal credentials
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required permissions for security
- **Regular Rotation**: Implement credential rotation policies

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup:

### Connection Failed

1. Verify credentials and permissions
2. Check network connectivity
3. Ensure firewall rules allow access

### Authentication Errors

1. Confirm role assignments
2. Verify warehouse permissions
