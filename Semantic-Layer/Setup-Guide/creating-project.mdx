# Creating a Semantic Layer Project

This guide will help you set up your first Semantic Layer project in the 5X platform. The Semantic Layer centralizes your metrics definitions, standardizes data access, and creates a foundation for AI-ready analytics.

## Navigate to the Semantic Layer Section

From your 5X workspace, click on Semantic Layer in the left navigation menu. This will take you to the Semantic Layer home page.

## Initiate Project Creation

There are two ways to create a new project:

1. **For First-Time Users**:
   - On the Semantic Layer home page, click the "Create New Project" button in the center of the screen
2. **For Existing Projects**:
   - Click on the projects listing dropdown in the top-left corner of the Semantic Layer page
   - Select "\+ New Project" from the dropdown menu

<Tip>
  The projects listing dropdown allows you to switch between existing projects and create new ones, all from the same convenient location.
</Tip>

## Configure Your Project

In the "New project" dialog, you'll need to configure the following settings:

**Project Name**\
Enter a descriptive name for your Semantic Layer project that clearly identifies its purpose.

_Examples: Sales Metrics, Marketing Analytics, Finance Dashboard_

**Repository Type**\
Choose between two repository options:

_5X Managed (Recommended)_

- Let 5X handle version control and storage
- Provide a Repo name for your semantic layer definitions
- Simplified setup and maintenance

_GitHub_

- Connect to your own GitHub repository
- Requires GitHub URL
- Optional: Specify subdirectory path

<Info>
  When importing an existing repository, ensure it follows the Cube project structure. The Semantic Layer requires specific file organization and configuration files to function correctly.
</Info>

**Environment**\
Select the environment that defines your warehouse connection settings:

- Warehouse instance configuration
- Connection credentials
- Access parameters

<Tip>
  Need a new environment? Configure one in **Settings \> Environments**
</Tip>

## Finalize Project Creation

Once you've entered all the required information, click the Add Project button to create your Semantic Layer project.

## What's Next?

After creating your Semantic Layer project, you can proceed with:

- [Getting Started with Data Modeling](./data-modeling.md): Learn how to transform raw data into meaningful business definitions

<Note>
  You don't need to explicitly connect to data sources as a separate step, since the environment you selected during project setup already contains the necessary warehouse connection configurations.
</Note>

## Best Practices for Project Setup

- **Organize by business domain**: Consider creating separate projects for different business areas (sales, marketing, finance)
- **Use descriptive naming**: Choose clear, consistent names for your projects and repositories
- **Plan for scale**: Set up your project with future growth in mind
- **Document as you go**: Add descriptions to your project and maintain documentation of your semantic definitions

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during project setup:

- **Environment not listed**: Go to Settings \> Environments to add a new environment
- **Repository connection issues**: Verify your GitHub credentials and repository URL
- **Permission errors**: Ensure your 5X account has the necessary permissions to create projects
- **Invalid repository structure**: When importing from GitHub, make sure your repository follows the Cube project structure
