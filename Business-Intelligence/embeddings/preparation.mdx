* The **Embedded Dashboard ID** is used with the Superset SDK to embed the dashboard in your application
* The **Embedded Dashboard ID** is used to generate a new embedded guest token

<Tip>
**Domain Configuration Guidelines**

- Wildcard is not supported
- If adding domains, make sure to include the protocol (https:// or http://)
- Leave the **Allowed Domains** field empty to allow embedding the dashboard into **any destination**
</Tip>

### Managing Embedding Settings

The **Embed dashboard** option in the dashboard ellipsis menu can be used to:
* Launch this dialog at any time
* Modify allowed domains settings
* Validate the information
* Disable embedding
