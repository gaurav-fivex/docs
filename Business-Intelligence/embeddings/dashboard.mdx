## Overview

Dashboard embedding enables you to embed a dashboard hosted in a 5X workspace into your own application via an iframe. It provides a great opportunity to bring insightful data analytics directly into your native environment. This feature can be used by a variety of different stakeholders, such as a Product team adding analytics to their SaaS application or a Data team adding dashboards to their internal tools.

## Starting with Embedded

In this chapter, we've organized the dashboard embedding process into two steps: preparation and deployment.

* **[Preparation](/Business-Intelligence/embeddings/preparation.mdx)** - It involves the collection of specific 5X BI asset data, such as a 5X API Key, Dashboard IDs, Dashboard Embed IDs etc - this step does not require any particular technical expertise.
* **[Deployment](/Business-Intelligence/embeddings/deployment.mdx)**- It is focused on installing the Superset Embedded SDK to embed the dashboard in your application. This step may require some development experience.

Let's have a closer look at some specific features of dashboard embedding with 5X BI.

## Access Control and Security

Dashboard embedding offers a number of security features designed to provide flexible access control without compromising your infrastructure.

Authentication can be configured using your app's authentication and access can be controlled programmatically with minimal coding. You retain control of your user's access at all times via data permissions and, specifically, what they can see in the dashboard(s).

### Key Security Features

* Row Level Security (RLS) rules for fine-grained permissions
* Encryption for data in transit with TLS 1.3+
* Encryption for data at rest with AES 256 encrypted storage

## How does access work?

Your host app defines access restrictions during the guest token generation (used by the Superset SDK to display the dashboard). When creating the token, it's possible to define:

* RLS rules that can be applied to all datasets used by the dashboard(s) or specific dataset(s).
* Which dashboards the user has access to.

In addition to this, data requests will be checked to make sure the queried dataset is actually used by the embedded dashboard being viewed.

The rules above are the only access restrictions that apply to the Embedded experience. Embedded dashboards are rendered in an iframe without cookie access, so any existing 5X BI session will not be active when viewing it. The embedded guest token is **the only authorization method that will be used**.
