description: "The **BI (Business Intelligence)** capability lets you create modern, enterprise-ready data visualizations using a no-code, integrated interface. BI supports real-time and end-to-end visual experience using [dashboards](./dashboard.md) by exposing data connected to an array of [charts](./charts.md). You can integrate with a variety of data sources connected to your warehouse. "

## BI Interface

The **BI interface** is designed to support dynamic, integrated and powerful visualizations.

- A no-code, integrated interface to build and manage **dashboards**, **charts** and **datasets**.
- Data analysis using a powerful **SQL editor** equipped for advanced queries.
- Supports dataset integration with all major SQL databases.
- Supports **log-based** and **row-level** security options.
- Seamless support for **custom styling**, **annotation layers**, and **tags** to visualizations.

The **BI header** is designed into the following components:

1. [Dashboards](/Business-Intelligence/dashboard): Build end-to-end data visualization experiences for your business needs by assembling charts into your dashboards.
2. [Charts](/Business-Intelligence/charts):  Expose the dataset using charts to create custom visualizations as required.
3. [Datasets](/Business-Intelligence/datasets.mdx): Store tables and SQL queries as datasets by connecting to the required database.
4. **Quick access**: Add datasets, charts and dashboards globally from the interface.
5. [Settings](/Business-Intelligence/settings.md):  Manage security, customization and platform-level functions.
