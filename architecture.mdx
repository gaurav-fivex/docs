The above illustration shows a data stack with an active **Google Sheet** data source in the **Object Storage** category of the [**Sources**](https://docs.5x.co/Ingestion/sources.md) column used to transport data to a connected Snowflake warehouse.

## Active/ inactive capabilities

The layout is grouped into data categories as color-coded blocks and their respective [capabilities](https://docs.5x.co/Overview/features) in sub-blocks. The active [data sources](https://docs.5x.co/Ingestion/sources) synced with data transportation are grouped in the **Sources** column. A capability not yet configured in your current data stack appears as a greyed-out sub-block.

## Real-time data flow

The architecture layout renders real-time data movement using the animated data flows to indicate how the different data categories and their capabilities are linked within your data platform

## Navigate view

The layout lies on a playgroun.d where you can **move** the layout, **zoom in/out** and **reset view** from the bottom-left corner.

## Quick access

Click on a sub-block for quick access to configure a capability for each sub-block. The quick access panel on the right popup lists the capabilityâ€™s overview, features, and configuration settings. **Navigate** to the capability as required.

## Download

You can also download the layout in `PNG` format from the **Download** button on the right corner of the page header.
