## After the 14-day trial

After the free trial period, you'll be able to choose to upgrade to a paid plan at checkout. You must enable a **BI subscription** for your plan if you want to continue using the [BI](https://docs.5x.co/Business%20Intelligence/bi#bi-) capability.


<Info>
- After your initial free trial ends, your workspace setup will be saved but not live until you complete the purchase.
- 5X uses a [credit-based pricing model](https://www.5x.co/pricing?utm_campaign=Day1+Summit&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--oOwokEUzy0twCoEkBcFwndMxqvwRTrYEt48qGdwyNJTTGQzGsQXyJOuK79hc-xns6Tnuko2UWjiI9bH1ib-2xzVmL2Q&_hsmi=306344238&utm_content=306344238&utm_source=hs_automation&utm_medium=email). You have the flexibility to decide the credit tier for the selected products.
- Snowflake credits are independent of 5X credits, but both are counted towards capacity deal consumption. This applies if you are using a [Snowflake warehouse](https://docs.5x.co/Overview/Get%20started/set-up.md#set-up-5x-workspace).
