You can sign up with 5X using the default [14-day trial](https://docs.5x.co/trial.md#14-day-trial-) period to understand the plan best suited for their needs. You can upgrade using the standardised base pricing model to onboard with 5X to manage your data platform.

## Step 1: Sign up

Navigate to [5X](https://www.5x.co/) to create a free account, **sign up with Google,** or use your **work email**.

### Sign up with Google

## Step 2: Set up account details

Once you have signed up, set up your username and password as required, and **Continue**.

## Step 3: Workspace setup

Establish your warehouse to store structured data in a centralised repository for your workspace. You can set up your workspace with:

- [A new warehouse provisioned by 5X](https://docs.5x.co/Overview/set-up.md#provision-new-workspace)
- [Provisioning an existing warehouse](https://docs.5x.co/Overview/set-up.md#use-existing--warehouse) on either Snowflake or Google BigQuery.
