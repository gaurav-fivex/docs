## Data Made Simple

Here are the fundamental concepts that are important at 5X:

### Full-Stack Data Platform

- Designed from the ground up to run [ingestion](https://docs.5x.co/Ingestion/using-ingestion), [warehouse](https://docs.5x.co/IDE/ide-about), [orchestration](https://docs.5x.co/Orchestration/), and [business intelligence](https://docs.5x.co/Business%20Intelligence/bi) applications.
- Unified and secure user experience with [granular access control](https://docs.5x.co/Settings/Team/RBAC.md), no vendor lock-in, and best-in-class data engineering capabilities.
- Build data models, deploy them into production, and create and schedule complex data pipelines (DAGs).
- Incredibly efficient with [quick user onboarding](https://docs.5x.co/Overview/Get%20started/onboard.md), handling of intensive data applications, and workspace [utilization analytics](https://docs.5x.co/Settings/utilization.md) to scale your business.

### Integrated Developer Experience

[Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://docs.5x.co/IDE/ide-about) built for effortless data development:

- Interact with warehouse data programmatically and develop directly from the unified IDE.
- Use [SQL](https://docs.5x.co/IDE/Editors/sql.md) for warehouse and ingestion data queries, and [dbt](https://docs.5x.co/IDE/Editors/dbt.md) to model data (more language support coming soon).
- Utilize version control to develop dbt models for downstream orchestration jobs.

### Data Governance and Security

5X is SOC2 compliant. It handles the underlying workspace data warehouse by building an instance on top of it to ensure robust data governance and security.

## Why Choose 5X?

5X, as a full-stack data platform, prepares you for data readiness to harness data analytics and scale your business outcomes.
