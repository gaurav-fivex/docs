## Integration Options

We offer two methods for integrating your data warehouse with 5X:

1. **Provision New Warehouse**: If you don't have an existing data warehouse or prefer to start fresh, 5X can provision a new Snowflake warehouse for you.

2. **Import Your Own Warehouse**: If you have an existing data warehouse, you can connect it to your 5X workspace.

## Option 1: Provision a New Warehouse

If you don't have an existing data warehouse, 5X can provision one for you using Snowflake. Here's how to set it up:

1. Choose **Provision a New Warehouse** when prompted during the workspace setup, select **"No, I don't have a warehouse yet"**.

2. Click **"Continue with 5X provisioned warehouse"** to initiate the Snowflake account setup process.

3. **Configure Your Snowflake Plan**
   - Choose your preferred cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform).
   - Select the geographic region for your data storage and processing.
   - Pick a Snowflake edition that suits your needs:
     - Standard: For basic data warehousing and analytics
     - Enterprise: For advanced features and higher performance
     - Business Critical: For the highest level of security and availability

4. **Await Provisioning Completion**
   - 5X will now set up your Snowflake account with the specified configuration.
   - This process typically takes a few seconds to complete.

5. **Receive Account Details**
   - Once provisioning is complete, the 5X team will provide you with your Snowflake account details.
   - These details will include:
     - Your unique Snowflake account URL
     - Login credentials for the initial admin user
     - Information on how to access your new Snowflake account
