From the Jobs page, you can:

1. [Add and deploy a new job](/Orchestration/deploy): Create a new orchestration pipeline from the **\+ New Job** button on the top-right of the Jobs page.
2. Track and analyse your pipeline using [job run history](#job-runs-and-logs) and job logs.
3. [Manage current jobs](#current-jobs) to enable/disable them, test, and delete jobs.

## Job editor

Build and orchestrate data pipeline on the Editor. The Job editor is a playground where you can:

- [Add node blocks](/Orchestration/deploy.mdx#3-add-the-first-node-block)
- **Drag and drop** blocks across your pipeline.
- **Zoom in/out** of the editor view.
- [Run a draft job](/Orchestration/deploy.mdx#7-run-draft-job) in the development environment before deploying it to production.

1. Click **Edit** to update the job in the editor.
2. Click **Run now** to trigger a manual job run.
3. Check the job logs of each task node. Click **View Logs** at the foot of a block to check its logs.

## Job runs and logs

The Job Runs page lists the run history of the respective job since its deployment.

- `runID`: When the job runs based on the scheduled trigger, each run history is generated and stored using a job `runID`.
- **Trigger**: Indicates if the job run was triggered manually or using the trigger schedule.
- **Status**: Indicates the job run status: **running**, **success**, and **failure**.
- **Start date** and **duration**: the time when the run started and its duration.

### Run history and logs

1. Navigate to your **Jobs** and click on a current job to check its details.
2. **Run a manual job**: you can manually run a job from the three-dot menu in the Actions column of the Jobs page.
3. Navigate to the **Job Runs** page of a job to check its run history.
4. Click on a job run to check its details and **logs**.
   - The pipeline overview highlights the task blocks by their **job run status**.
   - Click on a task block to check and **download** its **job run logs**.

- **Environment**: indicates which production environment is used to deploy.
- **Container size**: Orchestration uses small, medium and large container sizes to deploy jobs.
- **Recent runs**: indicates the history of the last five job runs by their run status. Hover over a run cycle to view its runID, status and time.
- **Actions**: you can perform actions to manage your current jobs from the **three-dot menu** in the Actions column.

### Resume/pause job

**Resume/pause** a job from the **three-dot** dropdown menu in the **Actions** column of a job.

### Rename job

Click **Rename** job to update its name from the t**hree-dot** dropdown menu in the **Actions** column of a job.

### Run now

Click **Run now** to run the jobs manually from the **three-dot** dropdown menu in the **Actions** column of a job.
