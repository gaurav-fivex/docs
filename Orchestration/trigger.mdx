## Trigger Types

### 1. Manual Trigger

#### Description
The manual trigger allows users to initiate jobs on-demand through the user interface. This trigger type is ideal for jobs that require human discretion or occasional execution.

#### Use Cases
- One-time data transformations
- Ad-hoc analysis tasks
- Testing and validation workflows
- Emergency or maintenance operations

#### Configuration
1. Select "Manual" when creating a new job trigger
2. No additional configuration required
3. Jobs can be initiated via the "Run" button in the interface

### 2. Scheduled Trigger

#### Description
Scheduled triggers automate job execution based on predefined time intervals. Users can specify precise timing using either preset options or custom cron expressions.

#### Configuration Options
1. **Time-based Settings**:
   - Daily execution
   - Weekly execution
   - Monthly execution

2. **Cron Expression Configuration**:
   - Format: `* * * * *` (minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week)
   - Examples:
     - `0 0 * * *` - Run daily at midnight
     - `0 */2 * * *` - Run every 2 hours
     - `30 18 * * MON-FRI` - Run at 6:30 PM on weekdays
   - UI-based cron builder available for easier configuration
   - Supports standard cron syntax including:
     - `*` (any value)
     - `,` (value list separator)
     - `-` (range of values)
     - `/` (step values)
     - Special characters: `?` `L` `W` `#`
   
3. **Advanced Scheduling**:
   - Custom cron expressions for complex scheduling patterns
   - Timezone configuration
   - Interval-based execution

#### Best Practices
- Use clear naming conventions for scheduled jobs
- Document the purpose of each schedule
- Consider dependencies when setting execution times
- Test cron expressions thoroughly before deployment

### 3. Webhook Trigger

#### Description
Webhook triggers enable job execution in response to HTTP requests, allowing integration with external systems and event-driven workflows.

#### Setup Process
1. Select webhook trigger type when creating a new job
2. Configure authorization settings
3. Save the trigger to generate a unique webhook URL
4. Optional: Disable authorization if not required

#### Security Considerations
- Authorization keys are provided for secure webhook access
- Keep authorization keys confidential
- Regularly rotate authorization keys for security
- Monitor webhook access patterns

#### Example Configuration
```plaintext
Webhook URL: https://api.5x.com/trigger/{job-id}
Authorization Header: X-5X-Auth-Key: {your-auth-key}
```

### 4. Pull Request Trigger

#### Description
Pull Request (PR) triggers automatically initiate jobs when pull requests are created in connected GitHub repositories. This trigger type is essential for automated testing and validation workflows.

#### Setup Requirements
1. GitHub repository connection
2. Appropriate repository permissions
3. Configured webhook in GitHub settings

#### Configuration Steps
1. Select PR trigger type
2. Choose the target GitHub repository
3. Configure the job workflow
4. Save trigger settings
